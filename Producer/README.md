# Project Description: Implementing Producer and Consumer with Spring Boot and Apache Kafka

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in developing a distributed messaging system using Spring Boot and Apache Kafka. The main objective is to implement both producer and consumer services in Java, demonstrating the capabilities of Kafka as a robust message broker for high-throughput, low-latency data streaming.

## Project Objectives:
1. **Set Up Kafka Environment:** Install and configure Apache Kafka to create a local development environment.
2. **Spring Boot Integration:** Integrate Kafka with a Spring Boot application to leverage Spring's powerful dependency injection and configuration management features.
3. **Producer Implementation:** Develop a Kafka producer in Java using Spring Boot to send messages to Kafka topics.
4. **Consumer Implementation:** Create a Kafka consumer in Java using Spring Boot to read and process messages from Kafka topics.
5. **Message Serialization/Deserialization:** Implement message serialization and deserialization using JSON or Avro to ensure data integrity and compatibility.
6. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure the system's reliability and maintainability.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the core concepts and architecture of Apache Kafka.
- Gain practical experience in setting up and configuring a Kafka environment.
- Learn how to integrate Kafka with Spring Boot applications.
- Develop skills in producing and consuming messages in a distributed system.
- Implement effective error handling and logging strategies.
